Running the otests with Tuscany using Maven
===========================================

cd otest/newlayout
mvn

should build and run all of the otests

The file otest\newlayout\tuscany-test-runner\src\test\resources\oasis-sca-tests.properties configures the 
test environment. Currently you can run in either the Java standalone or OSGi runtimes
which is configured by the org.oasis.sca.tests.assembly.runtime_bridge property.

Running the otests with Tuscany using Eclipse
=============================================

cd otest/newlayout
mvn eclipse:eclipse

import otest/newlayout/tuscany-test-runner into eclipse
import otest/newlayout/sca-assembly/General into eclipse
import otest/newlayout/sca-assembly/General_Java into eclipse

import which ever other contributions you need into eclipse (depends on which tests you are running)
  
Structure of the otests
======================

The otest directory, once checked out, contains files from both OASIS and Tuscany svn. As follows

otest/
  newlayout/             - the latest otests
    tuscany-test-runner  - the tuscany specific code + code copied from sca-assembly/Test_Client
    sca-assembly/        - the otest source pulled directly from OASIS svn via svn:externals

The Junit test cases are copied, using an ant script called by maven, from sca-assembly/Test_Client
into tuscany-test-runner so that we can overlay them with Tuscany specific bridges and property
files. In particular the Tuscany version of the test property files can be found at

tuscany-test-runner/src/test/resources/

Maven puts this on the classpath before 

tuscany-test-runner/src/main/resources

Which is where the otest versions get copied to and hence the Tuscany ones get picked up.
