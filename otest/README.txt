Tests are pulled into the fixed_version and currrent subdirectories using svn:externals to extract the tests directly from oasis. As we don't have control over changes in the OASIS build structure, the extraction into the fixed_version will be a selected OASIS svn repository version, intended to be stable (though not necessarily all tests passing)

(the fixed_version directory has been removed for the time being)
