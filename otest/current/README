Running the otests with Tuscany using Maven

mvn

should build and run all of the otests


Running the otests with Tuscany using Eclipse
=============================================

cd otest/current
mvn eclipse:eclipse

import otest/current/tests into eclipse

this gives you all the unit tests. The imported project won't be 
linked to the source correctly. What you need to do is open the 
project properties. Remove the source dir and add a link to 
otest/current/src/test/java

We don't have a good way to generate the eclipse project files
to inlcude this link automatically currently and we are looking
to see what the most appropriate approach is to make this process
as painless as possible.
