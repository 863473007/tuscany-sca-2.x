Running the otests with Tuscany using Maven
===========================================

cd otest/current
mvn

should build and run all of the otests


Running the otests with Tuscany using Eclipse
=============================================

cd otest/current
mvn eclipse:eclipse

import otest/current/tests into eclipse
import otest/current/General into eclipse
import otest/current/General_Java into eclipse

import which ever other contributions you need into eclipse (depends on which tests you are running)
  
Stricture of the otests
======================

The otest directory, once checked out, contains files from both OASIS and Tuscany svn. As follows

otest/
  current/               - the latest otests
    src/                 - the latest otest source pulled directly from OASIS svn via svn:externals
    tests/               - the latest otest unit tests pulled directly from OASIS svn via svn:externals
    General_Java/        - the general Java contribution pulled from Tuscany svn 
      src/main/          - the general Java classes pulled directly from OASIS svn via svn:externals
    General              - the general contribution pulled from Tuscany svn 
      src/main/resources - code copied from otest/current/src/resources/General
    ASM_****
      src/main/resources - code copied from otest/current/src/resources/AMS_****

The code is copied from src/main/resources to the appropriate contribution each 
time maven is used to compile the contribution in question. There is a build setting
in each contribution pom that does the copy. 

This all seems a bit complicated but is structured like this because the OASIS tests
don't come with a build system. We want to be able to build in both maven and eclipse
in the same way as we do with the rest of our code

You will note that there are a lot of contributions and it would seem to be a big job
if we need to make changes to the build across all the contributions. However there
is an ant script that sets up the contribution modules. 

otest/current/ant fixUpContributions

Creates the src/main/resource directory and copies in the pom from the template-pom.xml file
