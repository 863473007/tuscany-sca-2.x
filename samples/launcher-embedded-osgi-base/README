OSGI Sample Launcher
===================

This directory contains a sample launcher for the running the
tuscany sample contributions in an OSGI environment.

The difference between this sample and the sample with the name without the
-base suffix is that this one uses the Tuscany aggregated jar to minimize the
jars a user needs to use.

The README file in the <distribution-unpack-dir>/samples directory provides 
general instructions about building and running sample contributions using the
tuscany sample launchers. ( where
distribution-unpack-dir is the directory in which you unpacked the tuscany
binary distribution archive)

To use this sample OSGI launcher with ant excute the command

ant run-<contributionname>

where run-<contributionname> is one of the targets in the build.xml file

To use this sample launcher to run all of the contributions as junit test cases,
execute the command "mvn" in the launcher directory.
