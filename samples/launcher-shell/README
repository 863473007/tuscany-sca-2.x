Sample Tuscany Shell
====================

This directory contains a sample shell program supporting simple commands to
start and stop SCA composites.

To build the sample shell do this:
mvn install
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies

To run it:
./sca

at the prompt:
start myNode mySampleContrib ../contribution-implementation-java-calculator/target/classes

or:
start myNode mySampleContrib http://people.apache.org/~jsdelfino/tuscany/java/test/sample-contribution-binding-ws-calculator.jar

also try:
status
stop myNode
bye

Starting and stopping composites is pretty fast. To see that, try the following
two scripts, which start/stop a sample composite 10 times.

./sca <sca-test
or
./sca <sca-test-remote
