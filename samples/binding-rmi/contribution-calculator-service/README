Calculator RMI Service Sample Contribution
==========================================

This sample illustrates the use of Tuscany RMI Binding to expose component 
services as Java RMI Services. It also demonstrates how a simple Java RMI 
Client application invokes the SCA Application's services exposed as RMI 
Services.

The README in the <distribution-unpack-dir>/samples directory provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. ( where
distribution-unpack-dir is the directory in which you unpacked the tuscany
binary distribution archive) Take a look there for instructions on how to launch
this sample contribution. 


Sample Overview
---------------
This sample extends the calculator sample by replacing the local service 
binding with an RMI binding. SO a java client can call the service exposed
by the SCA application using an RMI client.

Amongst the other output created by the launcher/contribution combination,  you should see the following output ...


     [java] 3 + 2=5.0
     [java] 3 - 2=1.0
     [java] 3 * 2=6.0
     [java] 3 / 2=1.5
