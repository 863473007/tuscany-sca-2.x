Calculator RMI Reference Sample Contribution
============================================

This sample illustrates the use of Tuscany RMI Binding to call reference 
services that are hosted as Java RMI services.  

The README in the <distribution-unpack-dir>/samples directory provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. ( where
distribution-unpack-dir is the directory in which you unpacked the tuscany
binary distribution archive) Take a look there for instructions on how to launch
this sample contribution. 

Sample Overview
---------------
This sample extends the calculator sample by replacing the local wired 
connections with RMI bindings. Instead of local add, subtract, multiply and 
divide components, an RMI service implementation now provides the
add, subtract, multiply and divide interfaces and is hosted as an RMI server. 
References specified in the .composite file include an RMI binding which targets
this RMI server.
Note. As this test creates and uses local network connections you may need to 
configure your firewall, if you are running one, to allow the test to run
successfully.         

Amongst the other output created by the launcher/contribution combination,  you should see the following output ...


     [java] 3 + 2=5.0
     [java] 3 - 2=1.0
     [java] 3 * 2=6.0
     [java] 3 / 2=1.5
