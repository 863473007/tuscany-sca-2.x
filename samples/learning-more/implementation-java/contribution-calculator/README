Calculator Sample Contribution
==============================

This sample implements a simple calculator using SCA components. 

The README in the <distribution-unpack-dir>/samples directory provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. ( where
distribution-unpack-dir is the directory in which you unpacked the tuscany
binary distribution archive) Take a look there for instructions on how to launch
this sample contribution. 

Sample Overview
---------------
The sample provides a single calculator service with a default SCA (java) 
binding. The CalculatorClient exercises this interface by calling add, 
subtract, multiply and divide operations. This results in messages passing to 
the appropriate components in the composite across the local wires.

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] 3 + 2=5.0
     [java] 3 - 2=1.0
     [java] 3 * 2=6.0
     [java] 3 / 2=1.5
