To execute a sample contribution from Maven

look for contributions that have the following configuration in their pom.xml file:

<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.tuscany.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-tuscany-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.0-Beta1</version>
</plugin>

For contributions that have this, for example, binding-sca/contribution-calculator, do the following

cd samples/binding-sca/contribution-calculator
mvn tuscany:run

This will launch the contribution in the Tuscany runtime and then wait. At this point you can use
other clients to send messages to services that the running SCA applcation exposes, 
for example, try calculator-scaclient.
