Sample Tuscany Shell
====================

This directory contains a sample shell program supporting simple commands to
start and stop SCA composites.

To build the sample shell do this:
mvn install

To run it:
./sca

at the prompt:
start myNode ../../applications/store/target/sample-store.jar

or:
start myNode http://people.apache.org/~jsdelfino/tuscany/java/test/sample-store.jar

also try:
status
stop myNode
bye

Starting and stopping composites is pretty fast. To see that, try the following
two scripts, which start/stop the sample store composite 10 times.

./sca <scripts/test.txt
or
./sca <scripts/test-remote.txt

The shell can also run as a Webapp. To try it install target/scashell.war in
a Web container, point your Web browser to http://localhost:8080/scashell
and try the links on that page.
