<title>Sample Runtime Shell</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>It works</h1>

<p>This Web app runs a sample Tuscany runtime shell similar to samples/launcher-shell.<br/>
To see how it works and what configuration commands are supported, just read the Shell program's <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tuscany/sca-java-2.x/trunk/samples/running-tuscany/launcher-shell/src/main/java/sample/Shell.java">source code</a>.</p>

<p>Configuration commands can be provided through a text document served from a Web location, for example:<br/>
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tuscany/sca-java-2.x/trunk/samples/running-tuscany/launcher-shell/scripts/test-start.txt">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tuscany/sca-java-2.x/trunk/samples/running-tuscany/launcher-shell/scripts/test-start.txt</a></p>

<p>To run that particular configuration script just point your Web browser to:<br/>
<a href="http://localhost:8080/scashell/run?conf=http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tuscany/sca-java-2.x/trunk/samples/running-tuscany/launcher-shell/scripts/test-start.txt">http://localhost:8080/scashell/run?conf=http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tuscany/sca-java-2.x/trunk/samples/running-tuscany/launcher-shell/scripts/test-start.txt</a><br/>
To run the script again and refresh the runtime shell, just refresh that page in your Web browser.
</p>

<p>Sample configuration script samples are available in the Tuscany Subversion repository <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tuscany/sca-java-2.x/trunk/samples/running-tuscany/launcher-shell/scripts/">there</a>.
