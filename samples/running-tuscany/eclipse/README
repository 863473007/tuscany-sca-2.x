To import sample contributions into Eclipse you first need to import the 
Tuscany runtime. You then need to import the sample contribution into Eclipse
as a project. Instructions for doing both of these things can be found here 

http://tuscany.apache.org/import-existing-tuscany-sca-projects-into-eclipse.html

Note. these instructions refer to our 1.x code base but it holds true for 
our 2.x code base. 

Once you have a contribution imported into Eclipse and cleanly compiling
against the Tuscany runtime jars you probably want to be able to run and 
debug it. The easiest way to do this is with a simple Java launcher. If you 
import the running-tuscany/embedded-jse project into Eclipse you'll see a 
number of such launcher programs which you can copy to launch the 
contribution(s) of your choice.
