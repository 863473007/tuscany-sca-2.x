To execute, and debug, sample contributions from Eclipse you first need to 
import the Tuscany runtime into Eclipse. You then need to import the sample
contribution into Eclipse as a project. Instructions for doing both of these
things can be found here 

http://tuscany.apache.org/import-existing-tuscany-sca-projects-into-eclipse.html

Note. these instructions refer to our 1.x code base but it holds true for 
our 2.x code base.
