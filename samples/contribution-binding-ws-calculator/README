Calculator Contribution Sample
==============================

This directory contains code which implements a simple calculator SCA contribution.

The contribution can be run as a tuscany application using one of the tuscany launchers
as described in the README in the root directory of the samples. 

Sample Overview
---------------
The sample provides a single calculator service with a default SCA (java) 
binding. The launcher exercises this interface by calling add, 
subtract, multiply and divide operations. This results in messages passing to 
the appropriate components in the composite across the local wires.

You should see the following output (depending on the launcher you use, this output
may be surrounded by other output).

run:
     [java] 3 + 2=5.0
     [java] 3 - 2=1.0
     [java] 3 * 2=6.0
     [java] 3 / 2=1.5
