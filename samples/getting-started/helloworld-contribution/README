Tuscany - Getting Started - Helloworld Sample
---------------------------------------------

This sample demonstrates a simple helloworld style SCA application and how to run that with Tuscany.

See the README in the top-level samples folder for general information on the Tuscany samples.

This project creates a jar format SCA contribution which has a deployable SCA composite. The composite
defines a single component named "HelloworldComponent" which implements a Helloworld service which
is implemented by a Java class. A JUnit testcase tests running the composite and invoking the service.

You can use the contribution built in the Tuscany Shell - at the root of a Tuscany binary distribution 
run the following command:

   bin\tuscany.bat samples\getting-started\helloworld-contribution  

You may then call the helloworld service with the shell command:

   invoke HelloworldComponent sayHello "your name"

This sample was created by the Tuscany contribution-jar Maven archetype. You can use that archetype to 
create you own SCA contribution projects by running the following maven command:

   mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=http://tuscany.apache.org

at the prompt select 1 to choose the contribution-jar archetype and then answer the questions. This project
