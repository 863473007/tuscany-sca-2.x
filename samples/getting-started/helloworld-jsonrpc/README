Tuscany - Getting Started - Helloworld Sample
---------------------------------------------

This sample demonstrates a simple helloworld style SCA application and how to run that with Tuscany.

See the README in the top-level samples folder for general information on the Tuscany samples.

This project creates an SCA contribution with a deployable composite named helloworld.composite.
The composite defines an SCA component, HelloworldComponent, which provides a Helloworld service, 
the component is implemented by a Java class. 

You can use the contribution by starting the composite in the Tuscany Shell. To do that run the 
following command in the helloworld folder:

   mvn tuscany:run 



   http://localhost:8080/HelloworldComponent/Helloworld?method=sayHello&params=WyJXb3JsZCJd&id=1



   {"id":1,"result":"Hello World"}
