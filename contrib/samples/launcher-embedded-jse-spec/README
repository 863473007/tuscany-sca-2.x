JSE Sample Launcher
===================

This directory contains a sample java launcher for the
tuscany sample contributions.   

The README file in the <distribution-unpack-dir>/samples directory provides 
general instructions about building and running sample contributions using the
tuscany sample launchers ( where distribution-unpack-dir is the directory in which you
unpacked the tuscany binary distribution archive)

To use this sample JSE launcher with ant excute the command

ant run-<contributionname>

where run-<contributionname> is one of the targets in the build.xml file

To use this sample launcher to run all of the contributions as junit test cases,
execute the command "mvn" in the launcher directory.
